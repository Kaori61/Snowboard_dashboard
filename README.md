- Medal-winning efficiency (medals per participant) varies greatly â€” e.g., **Australia has a 20% success rate**.

### Peak Performance Age
- Most snowboarders peak in their **early to mid-20s**, with a sharp drop-off after 27.
- Different disciplines show slightly different peak trends:
  - Freestyle events (e.g., Halfpipe, Slopestyle): Populated with younger athletes **22â€“24**
  - Racing events (e.g., Parallel Giant Slalom): More common for older athletes **27+**
